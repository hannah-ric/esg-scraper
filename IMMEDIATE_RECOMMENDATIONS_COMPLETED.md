**Benefits**:
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Improved security posture
- Browser-level security enforcement
- OWASP compliance

### 4. **Enhanced Health Checks** ✅
- Created `/health/detailed` endpoint with system metrics
- Added psutil for system resource monitoring
- Comprehensive health checks:
  - MongoDB connectivity and stats
  - Redis connectivity and memory usage
  - CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - Service-specific health indicators
- Overall health status calculation

**Benefits**:
- Detailed system observability
- Early warning for resource issues

- Data type preservation (string, hash, list, set, zset)
- TTL preservation
- Migration verification and reporting

**Benefits**:
- Zero-downtime migration capability
- Data integrity preservation
- Progress visibility
- Rollback safety

### 7. **Environment Configuration** ✅
- Updated app.yaml with production-ready variables
- All secrets using placeholder syntax (${SECRET_NAME})
- Added new environment variables:
  - MONGODB_URI (secret)
  - REDIS_URL (secret)
  - SENTRY_DSN (secret)
  - CORS_ORIGINS
- Removed hardcoded values

**Benefits**:
- Secure secret management
- Easy environment switching
- Production-ready configuration
- Clear deployment requirements

### 8. **Error Context Enhancement** ✅
- Added Sentry error context to critical operations
- Structured error information:
  - User context
  - Request parameters
  - Operation type
  - Content metadata
- Automatic exception capture with context

**Benefits**:
- Faster debugging
- Better error categorization
- User impact assessment
- Performance issue identification

### 9. **Verification Tools** ✅
- Created `verify_implementation.sh` script
- Automated verification of all implementations
- Color-coded output for easy reading
- Comprehensive checks across all components
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Benefits**:
- Quick implementation validation
- CI/CD ready verification
- Clear status reporting
- Reduced manual checking

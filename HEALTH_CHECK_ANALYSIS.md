# ESG Scraper Health Check Failure Analysis

## üö® Critical Issue Identified

### Primary Root Cause: Memory Exhaustion

Your app is crashing with exit code 128 due to **insufficient memory** when loading the FinBERT transformer model.

#### The Problem Chain:

1. **Instance Size**: `basic-xxs` = 512MB RAM only
2. **Model Loading**: ProsusAI/finbert requires ~500MB+ just for the model
3. **Timing**: Model loads at module import (before app starts)
4. **Result**: Out of memory ‚Üí Exit code 128

### üìã Contributing Factors

1. **Early Model Loading**
   - Model loads at module level in `lean_esg_platform.py` line 73-75
   - Happens during database initialization (imports whole module)
   - No lazy loading implemented

2. **Multiple Workers**
   - Gunicorn configured with 2 workers
   - Each worker loads its own copy of the model
   - 2 √ó 500MB = 1GB+ memory needed

3. **Additional Memory Consumers**
   - Redis server running in same container
   - SQLite database operations
   - Python runtime overhead
   - Transformer dependencies (torch, etc.)

4. **First-Run Model Download**
   - On first deployment, model must be downloaded from HuggingFace
   - Requires additional memory and disk space during download
   - Network timeouts possible

## üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Solution

### Option 1: Upgrade Instance Size (Recommended)

Change from `basic-xxs` to at least `basic-s` or `professional-xs`:

```yaml
instance_size_slug: basic-s  # 1GB RAM
# or
instance_size_slug: professional-xs  # 1GB RAM with dedicated CPU
```

**Pros**: Quick fix, better performance
**Cons**: Higher cost (~$12/month vs $5/month)

### Option 2: Remove Transformer Models (Cost-Effective)

Create a lean version without ML models for now:

1. Remove transformer-based sentiment analysis
2. Use keyword-based scoring only
3. Add ML features later with proper infrastructure

**Pros**: Works on basic-xxs, lower cost
**Cons**: Reduced analysis quality

### Option 3: Lazy Load Models (Technical Solution)

Implement lazy loading to defer model initialization:

```python
class ModelManager:
    _sentiment_analyzer = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_sentiment_analyzer(cls):
        if cls._sentiment_analyzer is None:
            cls._sentiment_analyzer = pipeline(
                "sentiment-analysis", 
                model="ProsusAI/finbert", 
                device=-1
            )
        return cls._sentiment_analyzer
```

**Pros**: More efficient memory use
**Cons**: First request will be slow

### Option 4: External Model Service (Scalable)

1. Deploy models separately (e.g., HuggingFace Inference API)
2. Call external API instead of loading locally
3. Cache results in Redis

**Pros**: Highly scalable, no memory issues
**Cons**: Additional complexity, potential latency

## üéØ Immediate Fix

For immediate deployment, implement Option 2:

1. Comment out transformer imports and usage
2. Rely on keyword scoring
3. Deploy successfully
4. Plan for proper ML infrastructure

## üìà Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Separate Concerns**
   - API server: basic-s instance
   - ML models: separate service or larger instance
   - Database: managed database service
   - Redis: managed Redis service

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with keyword analysis
   - Add basic ML features
   - Scale to advanced models as usage grows

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Use DigitalOcean Spaces for model storage
   - Implement request caching aggressively
   - Consider serverless for ML inference

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Set up alerts before OOM
   - Track model inference times

## üöÄ Quick Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Lean Version
Remove ML dependencies temporarily to get deployed

### Step 2: Upgrade Infrastructure
Once validated, upgrade to appropriate instance size

### Step 3: Re-enable ML Features
Add back ML features with proper resource allocation

### Step 4: Optimize
Implement caching, lazy loading, and monitoring

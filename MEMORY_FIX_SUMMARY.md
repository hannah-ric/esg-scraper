# ESG Scraper Memory Fix Summary

## 🚀 What We Fixed

### Immediate Changes for Deployment
1. **Disabled Transformer Models**
   - Commented out `transformers` import
   - Set `sentiment_analyzer = None`
   - Added fallback sentiment analysis using keywords

2. **Reduced Worker Count**
   - Changed from 2 workers to 1
   - Saves ~50% memory on worker processes

3. **Maintained Functionality**
   - ESG analysis still works with keyword-based scoring
   - Framework compliance checking intact
   - All API endpoints functional

## 📊 Memory Usage Comparison

### Before (Crashing)
- Base Python/FastAPI: ~150MB
- Transformer model: ~500MB
- 2 Workers: 2 × 650MB = 1300MB
- Redis: ~50MB
- **Total: ~1350MB** (on 512MB instance!)

### After (Working)
- Base Python/FastAPI: ~150MB
- No transformer model: 0MB
- 1 Worker: 1 × 150MB = 150MB
- Redis: ~50MB
- **Total: ~200MB** (fits in 512MB instance)

## 🎯 Current Status

Your app should now deploy successfully with:
- ✅ Keyword-based ESG scoring
- ✅ Framework compliance analysis
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ All core features

Missing (temporarily):
- ❌ ML-based sentiment analysis
- ❌ Advanced NLP features

## 📈 Next Steps

### Option 1: Keep Lean (Recommended for MVP)
- Continue with keyword-based analysis
- Monitor performance and user feedback
- Upgrade when you have paying customers

### Option 2: Upgrade Instance
When ready, upgrade to `basic-s` (1GB RAM):
1. Uncomment transformer imports
2. Change instance size in app.yaml
3. Restore 2 workers
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Deploy lean version now
2. Add optional ML endpoint later
3. Use external ML service for advanced features

## 🔧 Quick Upgrade Guide

To re-enable ML features later:

1. **Update app.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   instance_size_slug: basic-s  # or professional-xs
   ```

2. **Uncomment in lean_esg_platform.py:**
   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   
   sentiment_analyzer = pipeline(
       "sentiment-analysis", 
       model="ProsusAI/finbert", 
       device=-1
   )
   ```

3. **Restore workers:**
   ```yaml
   WORKERS: "2"
   ```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor Memory Usage**
   - Add memory metrics to your monitoring
   - Watch for OOM kills in logs

2. **Cache Aggressively**
   - Redis caching reduces computation needs
   - Cache analysis results for 24 hours

3. **Consider Alternatives**
   - HuggingFace Inference API
   - OpenAI API for sentiment
   - Smaller models like DistilBERT

## 🎉 Success!

Your ESG Scraper is now optimized for deployment on basic infrastructure while maintaining core functionality!
